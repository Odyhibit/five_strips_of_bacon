## About

Is it steganography if it's obvious?

no.

Bacon's cipher was designed to hide text inside other text, photos, etc.

Each character in the hidden text requires 5 bits of information. For example it could be if a character is bold, or not. Maybe wheather people in a photo have their head turned to the side or not.
So why not "hide" 5 bits of information in a single character? Who would even notice?
Turns out everyone. This is an obnoxious combination.
